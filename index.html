<!-- consistency of heads, naming conventions, units accross project -->
<!-- landing page vs home page. i think index would be the home page. idk ive only taken one formal class on web design & everything i self teach. i may not know specific names of things etc
but im smart enough to know where & how to find info i need & i get things done & make them work & work well & efficient thru my own learning method
